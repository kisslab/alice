Thanumalayan Sankaranarayana Pillai, Vijay Chidambaram, Ramnatthan Alagappan,
and Samer Al-Kiswany were involved in various aspects of design and testing of
the first version ALICE tool. Thanumalayan Sankaranarayana Pillai
(madthanu@cs.wisc.edu) is the primary author of the tool, and might serve to be
the best contact for bug reports, feature requests, or other general
discussions. Ramnatthan Alagappan extensively tested the tool, and Vijay
Chidambaram also wrote a part of the code.

Zhe Qiu (Shanghai Jiao Tong University) has contributed code patches.

The ALICE tool is a by-product of a research project
(http://research.cs.wisc.edu/adsl/Publications/alice-osdi14.html) in the
University of Wisconsin-Madison, and due credit must be given to everyone who
was involved in or contributed to the project.

The alice-strace tracing framework is a slight customization of the strace tool
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/strace/), along with some code adapted from
strace-plus (https://code.google.com/p/strace-plus/).  Credits must be given to
the authors and contributors of strace and strace-plus.
